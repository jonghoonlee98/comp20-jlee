1) Purpose: Revision control.

2) My favorite assignment was Assignment 3 because I liked working with the client-side of things, namely using the Google Maps API was very enjoyable for me.

3) I definitely learned a lot from this course. To point out a few, I learned how to make a website from scratch using HTML and CSS, client-side vs server-side implementations, and basic web security.

4) To never, ever trust user input. This was seen in being able to change the price of an item on a website via a proxy or inputting script to redirect the site to somewhere else.

5) I want to learn more about web security.
